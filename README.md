Welcome to the Customized AI Data Analysis App for the DIY Smart Crude Extractor!
This Python-based application uses AI to analyze data from a smart crude extractor and predict the composition of crude mixtures in extracting solvents. By inputting data such as RGB values, Hex codes, temperature, solvent type, and biological agent, the system leverages advanced Ollama AI models, including Llama 3, Phi 3, and a customized Phi 3 model named My-Analyst. the system processes these data points to predict the likely composition of the mixture. It identifies bioactive compounds such as pigments, flavonoids, and phenolic substances based on the sensor readings, enhancing the analysis and optimization of bioactive compound extraction.
